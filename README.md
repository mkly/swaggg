Installation
------------
Copy to the sites package directory and install through the dashboard.

Setup
-----
Add the _Swaggg_ _View_ block wherever you wish to have people view and judge things anonymously. Add the _Swaggg_ _Upload_ block where you would like to have strangers upload strange images and take no responsibility for them.

Configuration
-------------
Swaggg only lets someone judge a particular message 5 times. Any more than that an they get a deny message. If you would like to increase the judgement or to persuade others to value their judgements a little more carefully, you can set SWAGGG_MAX_VOTES to a different number in your /config/site.php file. The default is 5.
